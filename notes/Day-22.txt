# Algorithms :
    - Brute-force approach .
    - Greedy approach .
    - Backtracking approach .
    - Dynamic programming . 

# Backtracking :
    - N - Queens problem :
        - N value always be 2 power n . 
            - Two approach :
                - Row Based approach in which each row contains one Queen .
                - column Based approach in which each column contains one Queen .
            - Row based :
