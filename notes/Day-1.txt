Problem solving skill - pattern , array , strings problems .
DSA theory : 
    - mycode school //youtube
    - Take u forward (optimal solution)
    - LogicFirstTamil - Tamil content
    - Neetcode - to solve leetcode solutions

compliation flow :
    java code -->compiler --> byte code
    (simple.java)             (simple.class)

        byte code is in unreadable format

Example :
        class Simple
        {
            public static void main(String args[])
            {
                System.out.println("Hello world");
            }
        }

        - static is a keyword which is used to access a method without using a object
        - main is the start of the program
        - in java {} used to represent the block of the code
        - class name can start with lowercase but it is a Stardard to start with uppercase . It will not give any error in starting with lowercase .
        - we can rearrange `public ` and `static` it will not give any error but `void` and `main` should not change its order .
        - args can be renamed by any names .
        - 

compliation:
    to compile a java file use ```javac filename.java ```
Execution :
    to execute / run a java file use ```java classname ```

# OOPS concept:
    ## object
        - To create an object
            classname obj_name = new classname();
                classname() - constructor call
        - Memory of the class was created only during object creation .
        - object holds the base address of the object .
            Eg. if s1 is the object name then s1 holds the base address of the s1 object .
        - If any attributes are declared as private then it can be accessed using constructor or getter & setter .
    ## constructor
        - constructor do not have any return value .
        - It invoked during the object creation itself .
