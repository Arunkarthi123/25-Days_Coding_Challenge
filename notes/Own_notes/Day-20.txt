# Graph :
    - Graph is a set of vertex and edges .
    - It is non linear data structure .
    - It is not heiraarchical order .
    - It consists of vertices (nodes ) and edges .
    - A vertex is also known as nodes is a point or a object in the Graph and edges are used to connect two nodes .
    - Applications :
        - Social Networks .
        - Internet .
        - Biology .
        - Maps and navigation .
    - Types of Graph :
        - Without weight and Without direction .
        - Without weight and With direction .
        - With weight and Without direction .
        - With weight and With direction
    - Graph properties :
        - weighted Graph : It is a Graph where the edges have values . The weight value of an edge can represent things like distance , capacity , time .
        - connected Graph :
