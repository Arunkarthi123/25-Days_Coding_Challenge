# Algorithms :
    - Brute-force approach .
    - Greedy approach .
    - Backtracking approach .
    - Dynamic programming . 

# Backtracking :
    - N - Queens problem :
        - N value always be 2 power n . 
            - Two approach :
                - Row Based approach in which each row contains one Queen .
                - column Based approach in which each column contains one Queen .
            - Row based :
# Doubt :
    - Why pre and post increment is not advisible for recursion parameter ?
    
# C - programming:
    - Why 2's compliement is used in negative binary value over 1's compliement ?
        - Because , if we use 1's compliement then there will exist positive zero and negative zero .
    - Binary representation of float values and decimal values .
