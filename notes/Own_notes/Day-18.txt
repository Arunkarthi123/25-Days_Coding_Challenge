# Tree Data Structures :
    - It is used to store the heiraarchical data .
    - The base unit that stores the data is known as nodes(n) .
    - The connection between two nodes are termed as edges(e) .
    - In tree the maximum number of edges in n nodes are (n - 1) .
    - Root node is the node that does not have parent node .
    - The node which has a child node then it is a parent node .
    - The node which has a parent node then it is child node .
    - The nodes which shares the same parent then the nodes are termed as sibling nodes .
    - The node which has 0 child node then it is leave nodes .
    - The node which has both child and parent nodes then it is internal nodes.
    - The degree of a node is the number of its child node .
    - The height of a node is the maximum number of edges to reach any of its leave node .
    - The height of all leave nodes are 0 .
    - The maximum number of edges to reach the leave node from the root of the tree is the height of the tree .
    - The maximum number of edges from root to the particular node is the depth of the node .
    # Types of Tree Data Structures :
        - Binary tree .
        - Ternary tree .
        - N-ary tree .
    # Types of Traversal :
        - Pre-order .
        - Post-order .
        - In-order .
