1. Why we convert infix to post-fix operation .
2. # Stack
        - It follows Last In First out principle .
        - Insertion and deletion takes place in same end .
        - # Functions :
            - push() is used to insert the element in stack .
            - pop() is used to remove element from the stack .
            - peek() is used to get the topmost element .
        - # Condition to check :
            - Over flow : is verified in static allocation if the stack is full during push() .
            - Under flow : is verified in both static an dynamic allocation for if the stack is empty during pop() .
        - # Syntax :
            - Stack<Type> obj = new Stack<>();
            - to push : obj.push(element)
            - to pop : obj.pop()
            - to peek : obj.peek()
