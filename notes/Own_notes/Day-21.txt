# Tree in Array :
    - To get the index of the parent of a node is  [ (ind(node) - 1) / 2 ] .
    - To get the index of the left child of a node is [ (ind(node) * 2 ) + 1] .
    - To get the index of the right child of a node is [ (ind(node) * 2) + 2] .
# Complete binary Tree :
    - All levels should be completely filled except the leaf level . 
    - The last level should be filled from left to right .
# Min - Heap :
    - The parent node should be minimum than its child nodes .
    - It is a complete binary tree .
    - If heap is stroed in array then traversing from left to right and there is a empty space then it is not a heap data structure .
    - 
# Max - Heap :
    - The parent node should be maximum than its child node .
    - It is a complete binary tree .
